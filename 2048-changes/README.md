I used the same Heroku repo from my previous projects for this assingment. 
It can be found at https://dreadful-chupacabra-73426.herokuapp.com/

IMPLMENTATION: To the best of my knowledge, this project has been implemented
    correctly to fulfill all specifications.

COLLABORATORS: I collaborated with Maya DeBellis, Julia Depp, and Ballard Blair.
    I also got help by reading the course Piazza page.

HOURS SPENT: I would estimate to have spent around 10-15 hours on this 
    assingment overall.
