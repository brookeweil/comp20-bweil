> What is this purpose of this Git repository? 

    This repository contains work I've completed in Prof. Ming Chow's Comp 20: 
    Web Development course at Tufts University, in the Fall 2016 semester. 
    Other work from this class can be found in my brookeweil.github.io repo, 
    and my final group project can be found (and played!) 
    at questionquail.herokuapp.com
 
> What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

    My favorite was definitely the final project, because collaborating with 
    a group, dividing up workload and abstracting parts of the project from
    each other, and creating a really cool, functional prototype at the end was 
    a unique and amazing experience!

> How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
    
    I've grown so much during this semester. I went from knowing absolutely 
    nothing about Web to making something real, and I've learned so much along 
    the way. The difference is unmistakable.

> What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? 
  Cite two examples as evidence.

    The most important thing I've learned is how to best work as a group. For 
    example, dividing tasks up between front-end and back-end teams makes
    everything run smoothly, because each team can focus and specialize. For
    example, I don't have to know exactly how POST and GET routes to a database 
    are written as long as I understand their contracts as APIs.

    At the same time, though, it's important to be at least a little familiar 
    with most parts of full-stack Web Dev. For example, as a mostly front-end
    team member for this project, I was in charge of integrating database POSTs
    and GETs into our pages and gameplay. That means I had to understand enough
    about what GETs and POSTs can and can't do to communicate to my back-end 
    team members what I needed.

> Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to 
  delve deeper into?

    I definitely want to learn more about databases, especially SQL databases,
    since up until now I've worked exclusively with noSQL databases (mongoDB).
