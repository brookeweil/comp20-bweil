    <h1>Security Report Results</h1>
    <h2>Evaluated by: Brooke Weil </h2>

    <ul>

      <li> <h3> Introduction </h3> 
        This report will detail some security vulnerabilities found in Matthew Epstein's
        2048 Game Center implementation </li> 

      <li> <h3> Methodology </h3> 
        My methodology for this investigation was to look over
        the soure code and then try some black box testing by inserting HTML and Javascript
        tags and code into the database via POST. </li> 

      <li> <h3> Abstract of Findings </h3>  
        Overall, I found that the database was very vulnerable to bogus data entries
        messign up the entire page. Since there is no data validation on the back end,
        there is a lot of room to inject malicious content to the server. </li> 

      <li> <h3> Issue 1 </h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice) </li> 
          <li> Location / page where issue was found </li> 
          <li> Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer. </li> 
          <li> Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent. </li> 
          <li> Proof of vulnerability. Show pictures. </li> 
          <li> Resolution. Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved. Show code if possible. </li> 
        </ol></li>
      
      <li> <h3> Issue 2 </h3>
