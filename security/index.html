    <h1>Security Report Results</h1>
    <h2>Evaluated by: Brooke Weil </h2>
    <br>

    <ul>

      <li> <h3> Introduction </h3> 
        This report will detail some security vulnerabilities found in Matthew Epstein's
        2048 Game Center implementation </li> 

      <li> <h3> Methodology </h3> 
        My methodology for this investigation was to look over
        the soure code and then try some black box testing by inserting HTML and Javascript
        tags and code into the database via POST. </li> 

      <li> <h3> Abstract of Findings </h3>  
        Overall, I found that the database was very vulnerable to bogus data entries
        messign up the entire page. Since there is no data validation on the back end,
        there is a lot of room to inject malicious content to the server. This is
        a huge vulnerability to Cross Site Scripting (XSS). </li> 

      <li> <h3> Issue 1 </h3>
        <ol>
          <li> <b>Issue:</b> HTML style can be inserted via POST to the server</li> 
          <li> <b>Location:</b> 
            Caused while using POST to https://mysterious-everglades-39591.herokuapp.com/submit, visible 
            when using GET on https://mysterious-everglades-39591.herokuapp.com/</li> 
          <li> <b>Severity of issue:</b> Low/medium; style is annoying, but won't alter content </li> 
          <li> <b>Description of issue:</b> I found that I could insert header format tags while 
            inserting a username into the database. </li> 
            <img src="issue1_code.png" style="width:600px" alt="code1"> 
          <li> <b>Proof of vulnerability:</b> Note the bold format of my name in the score listings.</li> 
            <img src="issue1_pic.png" style="width:600px" alt="code1"> 
          <li> <b>Resolution:</b> Screen for angle brackets in DB input before inserting new
            document to DB </li> 
        </ol></li>
      
      <!-- TODO from here on... -->
      <li> <h3> Issue 2 </h3>
        <ol>
          <li> <b>Issue:</b> Images can be inserted as HTML via POST to the server </li> 
          <li> <b>Location:</b> 
            Caused while using POST to https://mysterious-everglades-39591.herokuapp.com/submit, visible 
            when using GET on https://mysterious-everglades-39591.herokuapp.com/ </li> 
          <li> <b>Severity of issue:</b> Medium; inserting an image can take up a lot of the page, and 
            having random images on the page greatly compromises content. </li> 
          <li> <b>Description of issue:</b> I found that I could insert an image tag while 
            inserting a username into the database. </li> 
            <img src="issue2_code.png" style="width:600px" alt="code2"> 
          <li> <b>Proof of vulnerability:</b> Note the giant meme taking up the page below.</li> 
            <img src="issue2_pic.png" style="width:600px" alt="pic2"> 
          <li> <b>Resolution:</b> Screen for angle brackets in DB input before inserting new
            document to DB </li> 
        </ol></li>
      
      <li> <h3> Issue 3 </h3>
        <ol>
          <li> <b>Issue:</b> Site can be redirected through HTML or Javascript via POST to the server  </li> 
          <li> <b>Location:</b> 
            Caused while using POST to https://mysterious-everglades-39591.herokuapp.com/submit, visible 
            when using GET on https://mysterious-everglades-39591.herokuapp.com/ </li> 
          <li> <b>Severity of issue:</b> HIGH; no one will be able to access the website, and if the 
            redirect is subtle, users could be fooled into using a fake/malicious website! </li> 
          <li> <b>Description of issue:</b> I inserted code to redirect the page to one of my favorite
            Buzzfeed videos while inserting a username into the database </li> 
            <img src="issue3_code.png" style="width:600px" alt="code3"> 
          <li> <b>Proof of vulnerability:</b> 
            See the result of visiting https://mysterious-everglades-39591.herokuapp.com/ actually
            results in watching a heartwarming Buzzfeed video on YouTube. Try it out:
            <a href="https://mysterious-everglades-39591.herokuapp.com/"> https://mysterious-everglades-39591.herokuapp.com/ </a> </li> 
            <img src="issue3_pic.png" style="width:600px" alt="pic3"> 
          <li> <b>Resolution:</b> 
            Screen for angle brackets in DB input before inserting new document to DB </li> 
        </ol></li>

      <li> <h3> Conclusion </h3>
        Without screening the data input to the database before inserting it, the
        site is open to enormous vulnerabilities. The ones I showcased here, via HTML
        and XSS, are relatively simple to maliciously plant. An easy way to fix this,
        as Prof. Ming Chow showed in his own example, is to sift out special characters
        in input fields/query strings from the user before inserting new entries
        into the database. Making even just this simple fix would greatly improve the
        security of the site. </li>
