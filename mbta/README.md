> IMPLEMENTATION FUNCTIONALITY 
    To the best of my knowledge, this assignment has been implemented fully
    and correctly to the specification

> ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    I recieved some help from Frankie Caiazzo, a Comp20 alum

    I used Prof. Ming Chow's example code as a scaffold for my own code. 
    I also used given formulas from Stack Overflow to calculate 
    distance with the Haversine formula.

> HOURS SPENT
    I spent around 10-15 hours on this assignment
